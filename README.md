# ‚ö°üñ•Ô∏èüëæ Host your own Lightning Address on LND
Lighting Wallets like [https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus](Zeus), [https://blixtwallet.github.io](Blixt) and [many more](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/README.md#wallets-supported) allow us to send sats to [Lighting Addresses](https://lightningaddress.com) like thats@satswellspent.com. We can hence pay without scanning the QR code of an invoice.

## Pre-requisites
- An existing Domain name and static ip address to express the lighting address(e.g. user@domain.com)
- A public Lightning Network node with sufficient inbound liquidity to receive payments to your lightning address.
- Golang [installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- A Webserver and reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy. (example setup instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-go-web-application-using-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04))
- Certbot to serve http over TLS. This is required since calls to the LNURLP are done via https. (example setup instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04))

## Features
- Implements the LN address protocol to receive lightning payments to an email-like address.
- Can host multiple lightning addresses on the same server instance.
- Notification support for payment receipts via email, telegram, http and more to come.
- Nostr NIP 05 style account verification, see https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md
- Nostr NIP 57 zaps

## Install and Setup
### Clone & Build
```
go install github.com/hieblmi/go-host-lnaddr@latest
```
### Configuration config.json
- `RPCHost`: Your lnd's REST endpoint e.g. "https://localhost:8080"
- `InvoiceMacaroonPath`: "/path/to/invoice.macaroon"
- `TLSCertPath`: "/home/user/.lnd/tls.cert",
- `LightningAddresses`: [ Array of preferred lightning addresses hosted by the server. Mine is: thats@satswellspent.com :-). This resolves to https://satswellspent.com/.well-known/lnurlp/thats ]
- `MinSendable`: 1000,
- `MaxSendable`: 100000000,
- `CommentAllowed`: If set to 0 the sender can't add a comment otherwise the number stands for the permitted number of characters.
- `Tag`: "payRequest",
- `Metadata`: [["text/plain","Welcome to satswellspent.com"],["text/identifier","thats@satswellspent.com"]],
- `Thumbnail`: "/path/to/thumbnail.[jpeg|png]",
- `SuccessMessage`: "Thank you!",
- `InvoiceCallback`: "https://[YOUR_DOMAIN].com/invoice/" - this is the endpoint that will create the invoice
- `AddressServerPort`: 9990 - the port your reverse proxy points to
- `Nostr`: `{ "names": {...}, "relays": {...} }` - See https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md#example for details.
- `Zaps`: `{ "Npub": "npub1...", "Nsec": "nsec1..." }`: enable Nostr zaps, DO NOT use your main Nostr key pair here! It is only used to publish zap receipts. Generate a new key pair by running `go-host-lnaddr -genkey` and use it here.
- `Notificators`: [
        {
            "Type": "mail",
            "Target": "username@example.com",
            "MinAmount": 1000,
            "Params": {
                "From": "thats@satswellspent.com",
                "SmtpServer": "smtp.satswellspent.com:587",
                "Login": "thats@satswellspent.com",
                "Password": "somerandompassword"
            }
        }
    ]

### Run
```$GOBIN/go-host-lnaddr --config /path/to/config.json```

## Notes
This stuff is experimental. I appreciate your comments and if you have questions please raise an issue.
I just recently setup my own address this way so feel free to send me some sats if you think this has been helpful to you.
